Things to think about:
- syntax for concurrently running things, define individual threads?, run procedures?
- working with modules, or a class-based system like java?
- call-by-value or call-by-reference? (value for the Win)


module main {

	Int val = 2;

	Bool val2 = True;


	if (val2) {
		val2 = False;
	}

	val2 = True;

	while (val < 4) {
		val++;
	}

// 	Threads ts = new Threads(5)?

}
